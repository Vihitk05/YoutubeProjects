    # Comparison Operators or Relational Operators
    They are generally used to compare two values or variables.
    The result is always a Boolean value either True or False.

    > Greater than operator - True if left value is greater than right value
    < Lesser than operator - True if right value is greater than left value
    == Equal to operator - True if both values are equal
    != Not Equal to operator - True if values are not equal to  each other
    >= Greater than or Equal to operator - True if left value is greater than or
                                               equal to right value
    <= Lesser than or Equal to operator - True if right value is greater than or
                                               equal to left value
