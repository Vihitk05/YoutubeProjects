"""
    * Rules to create a variable
    start with a letter
    cannot start with a number
    can only contain alpha numeric characters and underscores
    names are case sensitive so name,Name, NAME are three different variables
    keywords cannot be used for naming the variable for eg. print, if, import etc

    not a rule but for good programming practice your variables must be readable.
